		<h2>Aim</h2>
		<p>The aim of this section is to get you familiar with the Rainbird scenario which we are using today.</p>
		<p>By the end you should understand what Rainbird is doing as well as having seen two of the interfaces Rainbird provides.</p>
		<p>If you are unsure of how to complete any of the tasks please ask.</p>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Step 1</h3>
			<p>Edit this html file using Visual Studio. </p>
			<p>Add an iframe to the code using the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>src attribute: https://app.rainbird.ai:443/agent/4fb4c8d2-6cdf-41a4-aecb-555bb0d78f60</li>
				<li>width attribute: 500</li>
				<li>height attribute: 600</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Place the iframe markup in the &lt;section&gt; tag with the class="right" property.</p>
			<p>You may find this webpage useful: <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe</a> (scroll down to see an example)</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Step 2</h3>
			<p>Refresh the html file in your browser to see a Rainbird interface.</p>
			<p>(Please ask if you don't see any changes).</p>
			<p>Run through the Rainbird interaction by first selecting the 'Recommend a Coffee Shop' query. Answer any questions Rainbird asks you.</p>
			<p>Rainbird will recommend you some cafes you could visit.</p>
			<p>Have a look at the Evidence Tree by clicking the 'i' icon. This will show you how Rainbird has made its decision.</p>
			<p>Behind the scenes Rainbird has taken the answers you gave to obtain your direction of travel (bearing) and used other information such as Google Star Ratings and Food Hygiene scores to produce a list of recommended cafes.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Step 3</h3>
			<p>The interface you have used so far to interact with Rainbird is just one option.</p>
			<p>To see another style of interface update the iframe you added replace '/agent/' with '/chatagent/' in the url used as the src attribute.</p>
			<p>Refresh the page to reload the html and feel free to run the query again if you like.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Finished</h3>
			<p>Well done! You finished this section.</p>
			<p>Next we will take a look at a larger project using Rainbird.</p>
